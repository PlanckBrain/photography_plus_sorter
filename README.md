# photography plus sorter
This program moves images from a source folder to a destination folder, sorted according to an order form
A new updated order form is created by running this program
If the files are not available to move, then the order form will mention that those orders are incomplete
	- Unless the order is already marked complete, in which case this scenario is ignored

Various variables are included near the top of the file to change should the format of the order form change
